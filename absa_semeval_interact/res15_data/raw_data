maggot in the food!	food
i've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table.	
the menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	menu, waiter, food
nevertheless, i finished my plate, and that's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.	mushroom sauce
i showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).	manager, manager
when the bill came, nothing was comped, so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but i didn't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.	
yes, i ate the food, but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating, and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.	
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.	manager
we paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.	
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.	food
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.	restaurant, customer service
a fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes, flatbush farm isn't in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world, but it's pretty good, albeit with a somewhat dismal setting.

once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!

for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.	
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka.	waiter

i would not expect this for a $55 dinner.	dinner, dinner
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka!	
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!	
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!	
to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.	
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!	food
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!	meal

five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a thursday evening.	
the hostess said "wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together", to which i replied "no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please."	
at first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.	
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.	menu

after we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member.	
the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order.	
we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay.	
she replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."	
we called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did.	
the food arrived in about 15 minutes.

also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.	waiters
i don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	
but if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for indian food	Indian food, place

wretched and retching	
this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life.	
they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.	
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service.	food, service
for starters they delivered us someone else's order.	
fine, i wont hang you for that.	
however, once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	kimchee, Korean fair
not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations.	
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	food
none was made so i hung up.	
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet.	
my girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	meal
not only have i worked in restaurants for many years, i am now in culinary school, i am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half korean!	
we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.	
it wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.	restaurant
eat at your own risk.

my wife and i visited dokebi tonight.	
we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum.	
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.	
the bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.	bibimbap, stone bowl
too bad i had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.	stone bowl
the nakgi-bokum was horrible.	nakgi-bokum
easily the worst stir-fried squid i've ever tasted.	stir-fried squid
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean.	sauce
the side dishes were passable, and i did get a refill upon request.	side dishes, side dishes
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service.	service
i mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.	
she just nodded and walked off.	
there were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect english.	
as to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.	
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.	dish
we were charged full price.	
if you ware looking for korean fusion, i suggest you try some of the places in the east village.	
authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street, of course.	
lives up to the hype	
we've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there.	
we've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.	
it was well worth the wait.	
the wife had the risotto which was amazing.	risotto
it doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.	
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.	farro salad, mashed yukon potatoes
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza	east village pizza, margherita pizza

this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!	modern Japanese brasserie, modern Japanese brasserie

my party had the bbe $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!	BBE $29 fixe prix menu, BBE $29 fixe prix menu
i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.	
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.	sashimi amuse bouche
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce.	
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree, which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better.	Grilled Black Cod, Grilled Salmon dish
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice.	entrees
the sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.	sake’s
for desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.	frozen black sesame mousse, matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake
maybe it was the great company (i had friends visiting from philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but i just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.	brasserie, brasserie
i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but i’ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.	Zenkichi, Zenkichi

the service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.	service
we were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent.	
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!	
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.	
they are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!	service, drinks, pita bread

dumbfoundingly poor	
this was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.	
lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn.	
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.	servers
polite acknowledgement is out;	
supercilious scorn is in.	
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	
a different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	server, appetizer
overall the food quality was pretty good, though i hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.	food
the place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what i could tell, a reasonable wine list (i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins)	fit-out, furnishings, wine list
at $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.	
on that scale, it's a world-beater.	
how is this palce still open?	palce
i honestly don't even know where to begin.	
my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms.	
we arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.	
we ordered our appetizers, i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon.	
everything was going good until we got our meals.	meals
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled.	chicken
it was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.	spinach
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat.	
i took one bite from the $24 salmon, and i have never, in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in flatbush farms.	salmon, salmon
at this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away.	waitress
so, i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it.	spinach
i couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.	
i've had better chicken at bbqs!!!!	
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.	
guess what, i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, i wish you would have said something earlier" no apology, nothing.	
after that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!	
no desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!	
i was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.	
this is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and i cannot comp it.	manager
again, no apology, no is there anything else i can get you, no can i get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!	
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.	
the level of rudeness was preposterous.	
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.	manager, drinks, appetizers
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience.	
this staff should be fired.	STAFF

casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian.	
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.	
well...they can run but they can't hide.	
i live in the west village and i've been to a lot of restaurants.	
sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.	
however, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.	
this place...god where do i begin.	place
it is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.	scene
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come!!!!	decor, eggplant, eggplant

we live nearby bfc.	
it's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years.	
each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return.	waiters, front of house staff, fish dishes
as bfc doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	BFC, front of house staff
the frizzy retro girl (with winged/ dame edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.	girl
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she "had a bbq to go to" that night - wtf??	
i'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	staff
there's another girl who i can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.	girl
i'm a friendly person, so i wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.	
again, i'd be super upset if that were my employee.	
considering you will spend at least $60 a head, i expect better service.	service
so, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...

his response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.

appetizers took nearly an hour.	
when the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.	
never got an explanation as to what was going on.	
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.	manager
when we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.	
on the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.	
can’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.	restaurant
what a hassle!	
the food is very good, but not outstanding.	food
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.	staff, wait
on our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.	
mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff.	staff
without the wait or attitude, i would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.

the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	waiter
i can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so i try to ignore it).	waitress
i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	
she then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	
i wish i could like this place more, and i wish someone would retrain the staff.	place, staff
